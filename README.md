COINFOUNDATION - GUAZZO GIANMARCO - PAO PROJECT



CoinFoundation is an application for investments in the world of cryptocurrencies. In addition to a list of
major cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and importance, a calculator is made available
for the ROI (Return of Interest) of a hypothetical investment in one of the aforementioned crypto. Each cryptocurrency has a
minimum possible investment and parameters for calculating the percentage returned.
The purpose of the application is therefore to instruct the user through specific information about it
the selected cryptocurrency and to make an approximate calculation on the possible return on an investment.
Each cryptocurrency has specific information in the presentation list which will then be expanded and described
in more detail in the section next to the list itself.
The project was entirely developed in English because most of the terms, if translated into Italian, are not
make the underlying concept well, and why crypto is a heavily foreign sector.
